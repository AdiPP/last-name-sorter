# Last Name Sorter
Last Name Sorter is a program that I built to meet the assessment in a job application as a Web Developer at PT. Kreatifitas Sinergisme Teknoindo (or KST for short).

The purpose of this program is to sort the list of names retrieved from files of type text (.txt) based on last name, first name, and middle name.

## Installation
After cloning this repository, please run the following command in your terminal to install the required dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
node app.js <pathtotxtfile>
```

After the program runs successfully, you can see the results of the sorted name in a file called "sorted-name-list.txt"
